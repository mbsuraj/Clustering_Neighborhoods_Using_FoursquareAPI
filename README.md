# Battle of Neighborhoods - IBM Capstone
## Introduction/Business Problem:

An internet service company based out of Phoenix is looking to expand its market share in the City. The company was providing services to 2
kinds of customers - individual customers and families; and small and medium size businesses. It was found out that the profit earned from 
small-size business such as restaurants, Fast Food chains was quite high; however,the company's market share of such customers was quite 
low (about 5%). From market research the root cause for such a small market share was due to the customers not aware of the company and 
it's services. Now, the internet service company aims to identify and target all the fast food and restaurant businesses using Foursquare 
API.
